# beeper-bot

Local-first Beeper memory and assistant bot.

## Purpose

Run a private agent behind a Beeper control chat. The agent indexes selected Beeper chats into a local SQLite database, searches them, and answers questions with cited evidence. The default design keeps message data and model inference local.

## Initial scope

- sync selected chats from the Beeper Desktop local API
- store messages in a local SQLite archive
- support exact and fuzzy retrieval for dates, addresses, names, and discussion summaries
- answer through a private Beeper control chat
- use a local `llama.cpp` server for synthesis
